Business goals included more time in the app per session and an increase in user accounts.</p>

              <p class='research col-md-6'> Our research started by sending out two screener surveys, which returned over one hundred results.  One survey was for online dating, the other about how people set their friends up on dates.  Overall, we were able to interview 15 people.  I compiled all of the data into one large document and pulled out themes that showed up.  What we learned is that a lot of people don't usually have people help them with online dating profiles, and people who do set up their friends don't like the feeling that their friends want the date to go well not for themselves, but to make the person setting them up happy.  As a team, we made an affinity map of the results.<br><br>I made two proto personas from the collected data, <a data-featherlight="img/meddle/michelle.jpg" href="#">Michelle</a> and <a href="img/meddle/vanessa.jpg" data-featherlight="image">Vanessa</a>.  Michelle is our single person, Vanessa is her friend who is looking to help her make a match.  Meddle is unique in that as a single person, there's not a lot you can do without someone there to help you pick a match.  This leads us to where my main focus was for this project, the tutorial.</p>

              <p class='design col-md-8'>Everyone on the team looked at the complied research and independently sketched ideas for onboarding and tutorial creation.  The stakeholder had stressed that he wanted the process to be fun and casual, so I tried to incorproate more circles to make it feel a little lighter and reflect the ferris wheel logo.  Making the language more casual to bring in that fun element.<br><br>The suggestion for having the ability to have preselected interests people could choose to add to their profiles to make easier sorting was to try to have a really simple filter that doesn't currently exist.  I wound up being more involved with the onboarding tutorial that also didn't currently exist.<br><br>The tutorial went through multiple iterations and rounds of testing, and showing the process of how the "Meddlers" vote on individual profiles, proved to be incredibly difficult to accurately convey in a static image.</p>

            <h2 class="description">Animation</h2>
            <p class='design col-md-7'>I came up with the idea of doing crude animation to convey the concept in the most accurate way.  I whiteboarded the keyframes that I made to show my team how many there would be to show the animation.<br><br>I made the frames in Adobe Photoshop CC using the Meddle style guide to bring the frames to life and tie them back into the brand.  I exported the frames and passed them on to the team member in charge of the Sketch document.  She was able to plug my frames in so we could control the framerate of the animation and get feedback on specific frames.  Based on user testing, we made several iterations of the animation, but overall user feedback was much more positive and much less confused than when the tutorial was a static image.</p>

              <p class='col-md-4'><a href="https://invis.io/Q9AHAWGEP#/219310642_1" target="_blank">Look at our final result!</a>.<br>I learned a lot from this project, in particular about to elicit information about something as sensitive as online dating and love lives.  Trying to make something to satisfy a lot of different preferences was difficult.  Also trying to add a twist to something people are normally familiar with and make them intrigued instead of mistrustful was a really interested challenge.<br><br>If we had more time, I would have put the animation into FramerJS and tracked down the web developer to discuss with him feasible it would be.  More user testing and trying to expand beyond the onboarding and profile creation.<br><br>The iterations from the tutorial went to a lot of interesting places.<br><b>1</b> The original Meddle tutorial was a single picture that was really confusing to users when we tested it.<br><b>2</b>This version confused users as to which direction the voting was going.<br><b>3</b> For the third iteration, making the profile picture a rectangle to resemble a profile and turning the votes into a talley helped a little bit, but we still had an inordinary amount of users confused about what was happening.Mbr><b>4</b> Changing the hierarchy of voters to be on top instead of on bottom and adding in the animation really made it much clearer what was happening.<br></p>
